When I started learning React ~ 2017 in Udacity, I followed a Youtuber who has enrolled in the same cohort. He used to share a weekly update about his progress.

After the first week, I hit the ground running with CRA, but he focused on building everything from scratch using Webpack tooling to x-ray what's going on.

After the third week, he published a video about his frustration with the setup and how it zipped his energy and caused him to lag behind his peers in learning React.

He eventually quit the program.

**I am not trying to say I was right and he was wrong.**

I am reflecting on how sometimes we get in our way in life. In my opinion, we should always strive to be in a state of flow.

Two great videos on the subject:

- [Joe Rogan & Firas Zahabi - How To Workout Smarter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fbCcWyYthQ)
