![2021 StackOverflow Developer Survey](https://res.cloudinary.com/fghurayri/image/upload/v1627946327/faisal.sh/2021-stackoverflow-survey/cover.png)

The yearly [2021 StackOverflow survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021) is out!

As always, a beautiful and well-designed report.

The highlights for me:

### The year of sabbaticals

> "76% of professional developers are employed at least part-time. Last year over 92% of professional developers were employed at least part-time. No significant increase in the percent of developers looking for work. "

Hey mom, I'm on TV!

In other news, the percentage of freelancers has increased too.

### I think that React has reached a local maximum

> "This year, React surpassed jQuery as the most commonly used web framework."

Usually, when a tech reaches its maximum adoption, people start to realize the local maximum and start trying to change the status quo.

In other news, Svelte is the most loved web framework!

### Functional programming languages are the top-paid technology

Clojure, F#, Elixir, and Erlang are the top-paid languages.

At the same time, they have the least % of adoption.

### DB technologies have the most love/hate relationship.

Redis, PostgreSQL, and MySQL continue to be the leaders in adoption and love.

Surprisingly, MongoDB is high on the list of love and want. I think maybe this is because it is one of the most approachable DBs for JS developers. Not sure about the longevity in a production system, though.

There is no sign for neo4j or any other graph DBs.

### Well-designed tech stands the time test

Git's 93% and Docker's 49% of love and adoption got me thinking about what other tech pains need similarly well-engineered solutions that can stand the test of time so we can focus on shipping valuer rather than trying to solve the same problem again with different tools.
